### Intro

GeoCrusade is a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), with a few twists. Foremost, the game is wholy open-source, and a sugnificant portion of the game's design and direction is lead by the community. Second, there are a number of mechanics from the real-time strategy (RTS) genre mixed in. Such mechanics include commanding units, and city building. Lastly, the game is location-based, meaning the game-world reflects the real-world, and a player's real-world location controls their character's location in the virtual world.
