## It started long before our time.

Many lifetimes ago, there was a society that ruled the globe. The ancients were a superior race of humanoids with vastly higher technology than what exists now. They flourished, until an unkown event nearly erased everything. Nature was virtually the only survivor. Sparse artifacts remain, scattered around the world, possessing fragments of ancient knowledge. Since their discovery, artifacts have become the centerpiece of conflict between the four new age factions.

## Four factions rise from the ashes.

### The Seirans

The Seirans believe that they are the children of the ancients. Thus, in their culture, it is wrong to say that the ancients went extinct. They simply changed form. In their eyes, all artifacts rightfully belong to them. They believe that they were both chosen and fallen from the one true creator.

They believe that only the purest, and worthy, can unlock the artifacts' true power by vanquishing the evil doers of the world and restoring balance to the earth. Therein, they see all other tribes as equally evil and misguided heretics.

They seek to create a heaven on earth, worthy of their lord to descend to in visitation. That is their narrative test from the heavens to earn their way back into heaven. 

### The Aeseons

The Aeseons believe that everything is an illusion and that the ancients aren’t really extinct. They believe that there was some sort of historical catalyst that required the stasis of humanity. Or, perhaps, that the world is nothing more than a training ground for a larger war to come, outside of the barrier. The Aeseons learned that the frequency of waves emitted by some artifacts can warp space-time. Because of this, they seek the artifacts to develop new technologies.

The problem with them, though, is that they are a faction of people who believe that resources should be shared and free for everyone. This is because they see competitive trade as another illusory part of the simulation to transcend. 

They view the Seirans as religious fanatics, while they view the Varukhai as soulless profiteers. Their mission is to liberate the other tribes from their illusion, so that they may achieve the next world. To liberate the other tribes, they must overthrow their leaders.

### The Varukhai

The Varukhai do not believe that the world is an illusion. Nor do they believe in the Seiran’s one true creator. They believe that the world was damaged by a meteor, which wiped out the ancients. What they want is to build a totally new world. Not to restore the old one, but to move forward into the future while letting go of the past and hopefully explore other planets.

They would be content with the few artifacts they have. However, both the Aeseons and the Seirans plot against them and violate the sanctity of their property. This is grounds for war to preserve their way of life and any hope for advancing into the future.


### The Zaegorians

The Zaegorians have no official theory about the creation of the universe. The Zaegorians are, for the most part, mercenaries who can be found serving either of the other three tribes. Natural born warriors, the Zaegorians are proud. As a result, sometimes they can be found infighting with each other. 

They would be the most militaristically powerful of all the tribes if only they could unify under one philosophy. They thrive and profit from ethnic conflicts.


## Hera - Queen of Aeseons

It’s not that Hera hates men. It’s that, in her perception, the men she’d respect enough to couple with are beyond her reach. She knows such men exist. She hears the stories of romantic tragedy left in the wake of people like Vaughn’s rebellion. She admires them; she envies. Though, this is not something that she can allow to seep through her mask.

She is driven by two powerful, core emotions: hatred and insecurity. She hates the world, for it isn’t just, in her eyes. She cannot see the bird’s eye view of consequence pertaining to every action having both positive and negative elements. Or, rather, she doesn’t want to see the bird’s eye view, because it would mean losing momentum. She likes her dark emotions, even though they may be leading her in the wrong direction because she’s not seeing the whole picture.

It’s her insecurity that powers her to win scientific accomplishments for her people: the Aeseons. It’s her rage that makes her fight like a demon when she has to. Doing so helps her defend the defenseless of her tribe. Meanwhile, it gains her universal respect and admiration heard throughout the tribes.

Therein, why would she ever want to let go of those driving forces? Why are they actually bad to have? She would never describe them as dark emotions alone. She wears the mask of virtue for the sake of public opinion. If her actions serve a consequential good then all other tribes must be wrong.

It is the Seirans who are wrong, who would shame and outcast her mother for falling in love. For being human. For being what a woman should be.

It is the other tribes who are wrong, who would take advantage of their vulnerability when she was young.

What monster of a man couldn’t see how her mother suffered? How she didn’t like prostituting herself to provide?

What repugnant excuse for a human being would try to rape an 11-year-old girl after murdering her mother right before her very eyes?

No. If this is the world of men, then it all should be burned down.

There might be individual good men out there, such as the mentor who reserved her from the battlefield and embraced her as an Aeseon. But there are not enough of them to make the world a legitimately better place.

This all has to be a test, at best. An illusion. If there is any hope at all for this planet, everything must be part of some elaborate program.

This is why it’s crucial that the Aeseons delve into the sciences, harnessing the power of the crystals to figure out the truth about why so many of them suffer, and how to put an end to it.

Her people, her new people, especially the children, love her because, somehow, she has triumphed over her struggles in a way that they can only aspire to. It would crush them, their hopes if they could see her secret: the true flames of wrath burning from the heart of a woman scorned too many times over.

Either this is all an illusion, or the world of men must fall…for the greater good of all.

--

Hera doesn’t have the full memory of her past. She’s repressed much into the depths of her subconscious mind.

She’s never seen her father in person. She only has a vague description of his facial features from her mother’s words, particularly his eyes.

She would remember having to wait outside of Inn rooms and alleys. She would hear the forced moans of her mother to please her clients. Her mother would have to please them if their income would allow for food.

From the highest ranking Seirans to common Zaegorian soldiers, all knew of her mother.

Though she thought them wrong as well, she felt less animosity toward the Zaegorians than she did the Seirans. They were animals, unsophisticated brutes. She could come to terms with an honest brute. A dog is a dog; a monkey is a monkey.

She could not forgive, however, the Seirans. Prostitution was illegal in their self-righteous tribe. So, the Seirans did what they wanted anyway; they just wore many faces. 

Several times, Hera had also been raped by pedophilic Seirans. Though, these were some of the memories she had repressed. There were times her mother was threatened and overpowered. Nothing could be done as they roamed the lands of the tribes, belonging to none of them.

It was during this nomadic wandering that Hera and her mother found themselves the innocent bystanders of a raging battle. The battle’s primary participants were the Seirans and the Zaegorians. Though they were not the only ones. 

A handful of Aeseon scouts were scoping out the battle from afar. They were gathering intelligence on battle tactics, measuring the strengths and weaknesses of their two rivals.

It was at this time that an older man, Sígjourn noticed Hera was about to be tortured from afar. A Seiran had murdered what appared to be, to him, her mother. With no father in sight. 

To him, saving Hera was not only an act of nobility. It was a method of increase the size of his tribe. Many of the Aeseons were talented, but damaged people. He himself had been taken from the battlefield of a different generation. 

In fact, almost every first-generation Aeseon was scarred in some way, deeply. It was their pain that bonded them together. Made them family.

He saw something of himself in the girl, and couldn’t help but intervene.

Though, experience had taught him that his willing heart was one thing; reality was another. The girl had to have it within her to fight; else, she’d become a liability to the entire tribe. He knew she couldn’t have been any older than twelve or thirteen to his eyes. That’s old enough for many a soldier in his day.

So, he tossed her a sword. He could see how frantic she was. The clang and thud of it landing right beside her caught her attention.

When she stabbed the ribs of the man about to fully overcome her, Sígjourn knew that she would do just fine with his tribe.

So, he brought her in.

He got her cleaned up. Fed. He ran through the same motions that he would with any other new recruit.

But, there was a fire in her eyes that the other kids just didn’t have. She learned fast, worked hard, and asked the difficult questions in class that the other kids didn’t even have the imagination for.

She was damaged goods, but she was talented beyond measure, and driven from her pain. He could see that. She had suffered more than most. Hell, most would have died by now. So, the fact that she even stayed alive to make it to sixteen with the Aeseons was a miracle in and of itself.

He took primary responsibility for teaching her how to fight. He basically became her father figure. 

Sígjourn viewed her as an adopted daughter. Though, he was clueless to her real feelings for him. 

Sígjourn was the only man she had ever met that she could trust. He was strong, experienced, cool, and always in control. He had scars like everyone else, both physical and mental. Though, he handled his pain with such grace, that he seemed surreal. The combination of both his kindness and how safe he made her feel made her fall in love with him as a teen.

…but, she could never bring herself to tell him. 

She knew he was a bit old for her. At best, she could try to get him to open up to her. He was always relaxed; yet, he never let his guard down. He was always sharp. Always competent. 

Disciplined. Rigid. Tough.

She admired him. One of the only good men in the world…yet, he was beyond her reach. 

He raised her through her schooling. And even though she excelled in ways that the other students hadn’t, she could never get rid of her dark side. The side of her filled with rage, that desired…no, needed speed, adrenaline, and conflict to sooth itself.

If she would, at all, remain a high-functioning member of the Aeseon society, she needed her bike. She needed the cliffs to jump into the sea from, to sink down into the bottom where sharks and other sea creatures could take her at any moment.

…but it never happened, no matter how much she’d want them to.

She was too at peace with the notion of suicide for the sea animals to claim her. Any other human who would cling to life would flail their arms at the sight of their hideous nature. That flailing would cause the reaction of the sea monsters to see them as a snack.

…but not Hera. 

Besides hitting the water, she would allow herself to sink, deeper and deeper, without so much as even stirring an eyelash. Such comfort with the darkness of the ocean convinced that sea creatures that she belonged there. That was equally a hunter as they were.

So, they’d leave her alone.

And it was this coolness of character that she got from her mentor. Becoming the hunter rather than remaining the hunted earned her a place on many missions by his side. She became an efficient killer and scout.

So, it was only right that she devote these skills bestowed to her by him to save him when he was captured.

Her success is what led her to becoming the leader of the tribe, by a landslide vote.


## Vaughn - King of Varukhai


##### Early Childhood 

Vaughn was originally born in the Seiran tribe, a son to a high-ranking political official. Despite being born during a time of war, his parents used their political power to ensure a peaceful life for him and his siblings. During this part of his childhood, he was indoctrinated into their cultural traditions. He learned basic survival skills, as well as literacy, and the arts.

Despite his parents’ best efforts, war breaks through the bubble they’ve established for their child. Zaegorians raid the area young Vaughn, his family, and friends live in.

During this raid, two significant events occur for Vaughn’s mind. With his own eyes, he sees his father kill for the first time. Then, Vaughn gains his first kill by protecting his father from a Zaegorian about to deal a final blow.

His village is forced to evacuate to a different location as Zaegorians start quickly conquering the area. The combination of stressors throws Vaughn into a state of chaos and nihilism. During this state of hopelessness, his father gives him guidance.

His father tells him that a man’s sense of purpose comes from his will to build and serve his family. That he should make the woman the center of his heart, and use that passion to build a better world.

To help his son, Vaughn’s father finds a girl in the village. He speaks to her father to make marriage arrangements for the future. The girl’s father says that there are other noble families interested in her. He would consider his son, but wouldn’t seal the arrangements unless he was sure that his son would turn out to be the most honorable choice for her.

##### As a Young Adult

Vaughn, his father, and several other males in the village have rebuilt their village, but in a different location. They conduct a series of counter-attacks against the Zaegorians to reclaim territory.

In efforts to gain more honor to his name, Vaughn makes the choice to take on a very risky mission. During this mission he discovers a beautiful Zaegorian girl about his age. He’s told to rape or kill her, but he hesitates.

During this moment of hesitation, his team mates/best friend acts to do the deed. He tries to stop them, asking a philosophical question about whether or not this is the right thing to do. That if they conduct the same kinds of acts the Zaegorian males would have conducted against them, are they no better?

Zaegorians warriors find them, surround them, interrupt them, and overpower them.

Vaughn and the rest of his crew are taken captured and taken as slaves. His best friend, who moved first to hurt the girl, is tortured and killed before his eyes.

Vaughn spends several years as a slave, growing into a full man in the process. He longed to return home and reconnect with his parents.

Throughout this time, Vaughn finds himself stumbling into fights and getting punished (such as by whipping) more than the other slaves, because of his naivety. An older Zaegorian with gray hair reaches out to him, asking why he chose not to rape the girl when he had the chance.

Vaughn’s answer inspires the older Zaegorian to take him as an apprentice, rather than keep him as a mere slave. Vaughn is then indoctrinated into the ways of the Zaegorian tribe.

With great reluctance over the process of years, he grows to love the Zaegorians and understands them as human beings. They are just different in nature from the Seirans.

During the tribal coming-of-age ceremony he undergoes to become considered a full Zaegorian, the girl that he saved from his late friend plays an unexpected critical role in carrying it out.

Vaughn’s Zaegorian mentor/father-figure teaches him something about a man’s purpose that’s contradicting to what his biological father told him. The Zaegorian tells Vaughn that a woman should never be the center of his life. That a man should have a goal as the center of his life, because women are fickle and untrustworthy. That if a man sets his sights high enough from an inner drive to achieve a goal, the right woman will fall into place during the process of the journey and self-development it takes to fulfill the goal.

Vaughn and the Zaegorian girl gradually fall in love and become betrothed.

Throughout this time, Vaughn joins the Zaegorians on their raids. The first of them are conducted against the Aeseons. This is no emotional problem for Vaughn, since he’s never interacted with them up until this point.

However, when he joins the Zaegorians on a raid against the Seirans, a massive inner conflict occurs.

He reconnects with his father, but not under the circumstances he’d have liked. At first, his father almost fails to recognize him. His father starts off trying to attack him, but upon realizing that the Zaegorian is actually Vaughn, there’s an emotional moment of mixed emotions. Vaughn finds out that his mother is already dead, as well as the rest of his siblings.

The moment of hesitation allows a different Zaegorian to kill his father before a forced retreat.

Vaughn experiences extreme emotional trauma as a consequence.

Seirans, more powerful than expected, make a counter-attack.

Vaughn’s Zaegorian fiancé gets murdered.

Vaughn enters a state of existential crisis.

After reflecting on the conflicting warring natures of all the tribes he experiences, he decides to leave them all behind and create his own: The Varukhai. Several characters from both the Zaegorian and Seiran tribe join him.

### Simon - Ruler of Seirans

The Seiran way is the only way. The rest are all heretics. Heathens.

They will all bow or perish.

Simon thinks that his father was too soft on the other tribes. What is the purpose of self-restraint, of mercy for people unrelated to you? Why should they be allowed to keep their ways of life when their ways of living have led to the countless deaths of his own tribe?

The murder of his father, himself?

The weak Aeseons, needing to strike in the night, pathetic they are. Cowardly. Indecent.

They allow women to fight in their armies?

Meanwhile, you have the Zaegorians. Mighty, but primitive. If his father had a harder heart, they and their unclean culture would have been cleansed…long ago.

There’s hope for converting the Zaegorians. They just need to be shone the light. Meanwhile, their blood is valuable for warfare. Their reflexes, their brute strength, and ability to endure the elements. If he could capture and tame their wild minds, absolute domination of the realm would be guaranteed.


Simon is about domination, period. He wants to conquer all other tribes without compromise. The reason why is because he has the Hamlet complex. His father is at the center of almost all of this thoughts, even if Simon is not fully conscious of why. He wants to beat and surpass what his father did. So, he’s willing to go to extreme lengths to do so. 

On the surface, it seems like it’s for his people. It may even seem like it’s for power or glory.

However, the real reason is because he is driven to prove a point. At the core of his hardened heart is the will to show that mankind can do better, and be better than previous generations. Simon doesn’t realize it, but, despite his religious beliefs, he’s actually the strongest advocate for human evolution in the entire saga. 

Take for instance, his strategy to conquer (but not eradicate) the Zaegorians. He wants to use their might against the Aeseons. However, the only way he can do that is if he subdues and converts them. If he “cleanses” their culture of its impurities for the sake of harnessing their natural strengths with Seiran schooling. This would create a whole new breed of Seiran under his control. 

…but that would be, in and of itself, a form of evolution (or devolution) depending on how you’d look at it. It is the actions he makes for the betterment of what he wants the future generations to be like that make him Darwinistic in nature, even though his persona is religious. 

Meanwhile, he’s willfully blind to many of his own contradictions. This is because he doesn’t have the psychological strength to face his own shadow. He’s never had to face his own shadow and, according to legendary psychologist Carl Jung, “individuate” because he had everything handed to him on a silver platter in his youth. 

His religion acts as a buffer against nihilistic meaninglessness, which is a critical weakness of his psychology. His persona is all hard. But he is like Achilles in the sense that if his opponent figures out what drives him, they could render Simon into a useless cretin if they ask him the right philosophical questions. 

This makes him starkly contrasted with Vaughn, who is philosophical by nature. Vaughn became philosophical by nature because of a series of unlikely events that made him begin to question his identity and the meaning to his life. Why he should be loyal to one tribe over the other, when he loves them both.

Simon, on the other hand, has never had the opportunity to grow as a character from that kind of internal crisis. He’s been taught one way from the beginning, and from the first day of his life, he’s had to represent a public image in the eye of his people before he got to explore who he really was inside.

This reflects in the subtleties of how he ends up speaking to the other characters throughout the developing seasons of the game’s storylines. 

Though, it is not Vaughn that he holds contentment for; it’s Hera. 

Starting back at the beginning of Simon’s timeline, he was born and raised in the optimal conditions for him to explore his talents. He was provided the best teachers, the best nutrients, and anything else he needed to succeed in life as the son of royalty. 

Through generations of selective breeding and arranged marriages, he has the genes for success in almost anything he puts his mind to. This makes him an absolute beast in battle that earns him both the awe and fear of anyone who beholds him fighting.

He is a tank, especially with his armor, who can eat damage from hordes of enemies without falling. 

When he was very young, he idolized his father. The people would speak wonders about his father’s wisdom, mercy, and all around noble character. 

…Or, at least, that was his father’s public persona.

What Simon didn’t know was that his father was a womanizer. His father ended up impregnating one of the tribe’s women, who ends up becoming Hera’s mother.

This means that Hera’s actually his younger half-sister. Though, neither of them are aware of it.

Before Simon reached the age of 18, he was aiding his father to conquer territories of the other tribes at 17. During one conflict, Simon led a campaign that led to the capture of a famed Aeseon figure: Hera’s mentor.

In the process of rescuing her mentor, Hera ends up killing Simon’s father, who was in the room during her mentor’s interrogation.

Hera’s fame/infamy with the soldiers for her respective talents on the battlefield (part of the benefits of sharing powerful genes) led the wounded soldiers of the rescue attempt to report to Simon who it was who committed the murder.

At this point, Hera becomes Simon’s number 1 archenemy, and spends the first seasons trying to kill her.

Neither one of them know their relation. Though, that is revealed to the players if the take the time to complete specific side quests.

 Hera becomes his worst enemy; though it’s Vaughn who becomes his worst fear. 

As they strive to accomplish key contrasting objectives during the first season, their rare dialogues reveal the weaknesses to Simon’s psychology.

This sends Simon down a mental rabbit hole of transformation throughout the first season of gameplay, which ends up having a ton of indirect effects on his decision-making as he pursues the death of Hera.
