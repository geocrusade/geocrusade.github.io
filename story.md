## It started long before our time.

Many lifetimes ago, there was a society that ruled the globe. The ancients were a superior race of humanoids with vastly higher technology than what exists now. They flourished, until an unkown event nearly erased everything. Nature was virtually the only survivor. Sparse artifacts remain, scattered around the world, possessing fragments of ancient knowledge. Since their discovery, artifacts have become the centerpiece of conflict between the four new age factions.

## Now we fight.

### The Seirans

The Seirans believe that they are the children of the ancients. Thus, in their culture, it is wrong to say that the ancients went extinct. They simply changed form. In their eyes, all artifacts rightfully belong to them. They believe that they were both chosen and fallen from the one true creator.

They believe that only the purest, and worthy, can unlock the artifacts' true power by vanquishing the evil doers of the world and restoring balance to the earth. Therein, they see all other tribes as equally evil and misguided heretics.

They seek to create a heaven on earth, worthy of their lord to descend to in visitation. That is their narrative test from the heavens to earn their way back into heaven. 

### The Aeseons

The Aeseons believe that everything is an illusion and that the ancients aren’t really extinct. They believe that there was some sort of historical catalyst that required the stasis of humanity. Or, perhaps, that the world is nothing more than a training ground for a larger war to come, outside of the barrier. The Aeseons learned that the frequency of waves emitted by some artifacts can warp space-time. Because of this, they seek the artifacts to develop new technologies.

The problem with them, though, is that they are a faction of people who believe that resources should be shared and free for everyone. This is because they see competitive trade as another illusory part of the simulation to transcend. 

They view the Seirans as religious fanatics, while they view the Varukhai as soulless profiteers. Their mission is to liberate the other tribes from their illusion, so that they may achieve the next world. To liberate the other tribes, they must overthrow their leaders.

### The Varukhai

The Varukhai do not believe that the world is an illusion. Nor do they believe in the Seiran’s one true creator. They believe that the world was damaged by a meteor, which wiped out the ancients. What they want is to build a totally new world. Not to restore the old one, but to move forward into the future while letting go of the past and hopefully explore other planets.

They would be content with the few artifacts they have. However, both the Aeseons and the Seirans plot against them and violate the sanctity of their property. This is grounds for war to preserve their way of life and any hope for advancing into the future.


### The Zaegorians

The Zaegorians have no official theory about the creation of the universe. The Zaegorians are, for the most part, mercenaries who can be found serving either of the other three tribes. Natural born warriors, the Zaegorians are proud. As a result, sometimes they can be found infighting with each other. 

They would be the most militaristically powerful of all the tribes if only they could unify under one philosophy. They thrive and profit from ethnic conflicts.
