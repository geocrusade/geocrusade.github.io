Google Docs says I created the initial game design document on Feburary 27th, 2019. So it has been 7 weeks since the GeoCrusade project began. Since then, a lot has happened, but there isn't much to show for all our work. There have been several design overhauls and reprioritizations that set development back a few weeks. It has taken a long time to get the ball rolling, but I believe we are now on a great path forward.

It feels odd to start this blog series on week seven, but the project is just now stabilizing, and the idea of having a blog didn't come up until about a week six. I'll quickly summarize what has been going on instead of retro-actively writing six blogs about stuff that isn't fresh on the mind. 

The project began with a document full of my initial thoughts for the game. This document included sections on game systems, philosophy, marketing, technical considerations, ect. I essentially wrote down whatever I had in my head, then shared it with a handful of friends and colleagues. 

The document got a lot of great feedback -- but people were not grasping the vision. So I created a visual guide with crude mockups made in Google Slides. It was not pretty, but people were now able see what....
