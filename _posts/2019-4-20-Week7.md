title: Week 7 Update
---

Google Docs says I created the initial game design document on Feburary 27th, 2019. So it has been 7 weeks since the GeoCrusade project began. Since then, a lot has happened, but there isn't much to show for all our work. It has taken a long time to get the ball rolling, but I believe we are now on a great path forward.
