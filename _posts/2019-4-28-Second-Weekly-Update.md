#### Talking Points
* Faction Leader Stories 
* Basic Terrain Development


Hello and welcome to the second weekly update post. This time I'll be going over the latest
work of Mike Norton, our marketing and literature guru, as well as the latest Unity development.

### Faction Leader Stories

There are three main factions in GeoCrusade (e.g. the Seirans, Aeseons, and Varukhai), and a fourth, smaller faction known as the Zaegorians.
At the head of each faction stands a powerful leader with a rich and unique backstory. Mike Norton, our man of many hats, is currently
putting a lot of his creative juice into each leader's story. 

Currently, the leaders are Vaughn of the Varukhai, Hera of the Aeseons, and Simon of the Seirans. 
Below is a snippet of Vaughn's story.

> It’s not that Hera hates men. It’s that, in her perception, the men she’d respect enough to couple with are beyond her reach. 
> She knows such men exist. She hears the stories of romantic tragedy left in the wake of people like Vaughn’s rebellion. 
> She admires them; she envies. Though, this is not something that she can allow to seep through her mask.

> She is driven by two powerful, core emotions: hatred and insecurity. She hates the world, for it isn’t just, in her eyes. 
> She cannot see the bird’s eye view of consequence pertaining to every action having both positive and negative elements. 
> Or, rather, she doesn’t want to see the bird’s eye view, because it would mean losing momentum. 
> She likes her dark emotions, even though they may be leading her in the wrong direction because she’s not seeing the whole picture.

You can read all of the latest literature on our story page. 
*Please note, all elements, including names, factions, and characters, may change wildly before release.*

Sometimes story can seem irrelevant to the development of the game and gameplay itself. 
I historically have not found interest in game lore, but I've found that it inspires the creative process of development.
Most importantly, we know a lot of gamers out there desire games with a strong foundation of fiction, particularly in the MMORPG genre. 
It is crucial to establishing a lasting brand, and will carry everything forward. I am looking forward to Mike's continued work, and sharing it with 
the future GeoCrusade community.


### Basic Terrain Development

Jacob Pulver and I have been hammering away at the core game systems. This week in particular, the terrain system. So far, we have a grid that can be navigated virtually infinitely with real-world map data dictating where land and water cells should be rendered. To be honest, the whole thing has been a major pain in the butt, so I don't feel like explaining the technical details here. However, the github repository for our Unity client will go open-source this week. Here are some very screenshots of our terrain system as it stands today.

This coming week Jacob and I will be working on adding more detail to the terrain such as elevation (from real-world elevation data) and a variety of land textures. We
will also begin refining rivers and building out roads. I hope to have something
awesome to share in the next post.


Thank you for reading!
