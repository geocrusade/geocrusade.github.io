Google Docs says I created the initial game design document on Feburary 27th, 2019. So it has been 7 weeks since the GeoCrusade project began. Since then, a lot has happened, but there isn't much to show for all our work. There have been several design overhauls and reprioritizations that set development back a few weeks. It has taken a long time to get the ball rolling, but I believe we are now on a great path forward.

### The start

It feels odd to start this blog series on week seven, but the project is just now stabilizing, and the idea of having a blog didn't come up until about a week six. I'll quickly summarize what has been going on instead of retro-actively writing six blogs about stuff that isn't fresh on the mind. 

The project began with a document full of my initial thoughts for the game. This document included sections on game systems, philosophy, marketing, technical considerations, ect. I essentially wrote down whatever I had in my head, then shared it with a handful of friends and colleagues. 

The document got a lot of great feedback -- but people were not grasping the vision. So I created a visual guide with crude mockups made in Google Slides. You can see the original copy [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/original_game_design_visualization.pdf). It was not pretty, and fairly different from our current design, but it helped people better understand what this project was all about.

### Looking for help

I have a full time job as a software engineer in Boston, MA. I knew if I tried to build this game in my limited spair time, it would take forever, maybe never get done, and certainly fall short of its potential. This meant I needed help - from at least one or two more people. With some savings, I hired Jacob Pulver to assist with Unity development, and Aaron Hunter as the backend guru. 

The backend of an MMORPG, meaning the server logic and database system, are the most complex and critical part. I recruited Aaron because he has the experience, writes optimized code, and is great to work with. He is the sole developer of [Starport](http://www.starportgame.com/), a classic indie sci-fi MMORPG. 

Jacob was a fantastic choice for assisting with the development of our Unity client. He is passionate about the project, has a versatile skillset, and is willing to face any obstacle that is thrown at him.

### Marketing

From experience, I know how easy it is to bury my head into the nitty gritty of a project, until it is time to release it to the public. Then, I'm stumped over how to get people to see and use it! 

This project could not afford that. I wanted to start building a marketing strategy and a community around the project before an initial version was ready. To me, it made sense to get the hype train moving as fast as possible before launch day. This is a strategy followed by pretty much every major movie and game. 

Eventually I found Mike Norton - a guy that will make you feel like a genius and an idiot at the same time. Mike is currently wearing multiple hats on this team, but marketing is one of his focuses. He is showing us how to create the game from the ground up with a marketing advantage. To sharpen that advantage, Mike is developing a lot of the game's fiction with proven storytelling techniques and a dash of his proprietary magic. More updates will be made to the [Story]({{ site.baseurl }}/story) page of this site soon!

### Painting the picture

As I said before, my mockups in Google Slides were crude. After we came up with the basic storyline, we wanted to bring it to life with some concept art. 

_Enter: Mangirdas Riesuta!_

Mangirdas is the newest add to the team. He is a charming artist who is _super_ stoked about this project. He kindly put together some concept pieces for the three main factions of the game. Check them out in the [Gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/gallery). Keep in mind, all this stuff is just concept art, and final release of the game will probably look different! But we'll make sure you think it is awesome, too.

He is currently working on an official GeoCrusade logo. We will definitely be sharing that soon.


### Development

Jacob and I are working on building the core terrain system. We are taking our time because we think with a bit more elbow grease, it could make the game world really cool.

Backend development is currently on hold while we build out a client-side demo for you to see. Backend development is time consuming and expensive - so if we don't yet need it for the demo - then we are going to wait. Once we get enough community support, we will begin working on the backend. 

We are aiming to include a few core system into the demo. Namely, include terrain, terrain features (e.g. trees, rocks, simple buildings), and combat against non-player units. We may add or remove core system from the demo release plan to be realistic - and we will keep you updated. 

The demo will be released during Summer 2019 - as part of our crowd funding campaign launch.

#### Open Source Plan

Our website repository is currently open source, and we will be open sourcing our Unity client, as well as all our backend repositories once they become active. Before that happens, we will be reviewing licensing options to ensure this project is protected - with the best interests of the community in mind. 


### Conclusion 

Overall, I think this project is sailing steadily toward a successful demo and campaign launch. We have a fine team and a solid philosophy. 

Thank you for your interest and support - please stay tuned for the next weekly update blog!


Sincerely, 

Kole Nunley      
Game Director
