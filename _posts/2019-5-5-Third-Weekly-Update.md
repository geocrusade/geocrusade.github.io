#### Talking Points
 * Client Repository Open Sourced
 * Seiran Faction Leader Intro
 * Terrain Enhancements


 ### Client Repository Open Sourced

 Just hours ago, the repository for the GeoCrusade client was set to public. The repository contains all client-side code for the game built in Unity. It can be found at [geocrusade-client](https://wwww.github.com/geocrusade/geocrusade-client).

 Releasing the client repository to the public is one piece of a broader effort to
 be as transparent as possible. The server-side repository will be made public once we begin actively contributing to it internally. 

 ### Seiran Faction Leader Intro

 An introduction to Simeon, the leader of the Seirans, was added to the [Story]({{ site.baseurl }}/story) page. Here is a blurb:

 > His religion acts as a buffer against nihilistic meaninglessness, which is a  critical weakness of his psychology. His persona is all hard. But he is like Achilles in the sense that if his opponent figures out what drives him, they could render Simon into a useless cretin if they ask him the right philosophical questions. 

> This makes him starkly contrasted with Vaughn, who is philosophical by nature. Vaughn became philosophical by nature because of a series of unlikely events that made him begin to question his identity and the meaning to his life. Why he should be loyal to one tribe over the other, when he loves them both.

> Simon, on the other hand, has never had the opportunity to grow as a character from that kind of internal crisis. He’s been taught one way from the beginning, and from the first day of his life, he’s had to represent a public image in the eye of his people before he got to explore who he really was inside.


 ### Terrain Enhancements

 Jacob Pulver and I worked on adding additonal texture granularity to the generated land segments of the terrain. Such textures include snow, grass, and sand. These additional textures are placed according to real map data from Mapbox.

 Additionally, we implemented terraced elevation based on contour layers provided by Mapbox.

 This next week, Jacob and I will be working on roads, river enhancements, and more! 

 Thank you for reading!
